This is the first repository I've created, and I actually don't know much about how it works, but I believe it's a good start because I successfully created one.
This repository is intended to be used to store C language code. This is all the code I am currently learning to write in C language. In the future, I will also store all the functions here, and maybe I will organize them in the future, but for now I will leave it like this.
Um. . . There may be other things added to this repository in the future.
